# Analysis-of-the-brokerage-account
Proud to present a personal analytics project — an interactive dashboard for tracking performance and structure of a brokerage account composed entirely of Polish government bonds.

🔍 Why this dashboard matters:
With consistent coupon payouts and fixed maturity dates, bond investing is about precision and predictability. This dashboard gives individual investors full visibility into investment activity, interest income, tax deductions, and bond lifecycles.

📊 Visuals Used:
- Donut Chart: Income vs Taxes vs Net Profit
- Donut Chart: Bond Maturity Distribution (2024–2027)
- Bar Chart: Top 5 Bonds by Total Income
- Stacked Column Chart: Monthly Income vs Taxes vs Net Profit
- KPI Cards: Key financial indicators (investment & income)
- Slicers: Date and bond filters by maturity year

🛠 Tools & Techniques:
Platform: Power BI
Data Source: Exported broker account file (.xlsx)
DAX: For metric calculations and custom switch tables

💡 Challenges:
- Isolating measures from global filters for fixed KPI tiles
- Calculating last-month annualized yield
- Identifying the next bond to mature
- Computing total investments and bond count

🎯 Outcome:
A clean, efficient report that empowers personal financial control — ideal for reinvestment planning, tax tracking, and long-term strategy.
